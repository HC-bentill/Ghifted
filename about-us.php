            <h1>About Us</h1> <hr>
            <p>Ghifted School for the Arts is a grassroots program that seeks to secure the physical and
               financial well-being of impoverished fine artists in Ghana, Africa by removing barriers to
                food, clothes, shoes and shelter while providing students with lifeenhancing educational
                 programming and professional development opportunities. The majority of Ghifted's target
                  beneficiaries lack the basic needs of food, clothes, shoes and shelter. Ghifted aims 
                   provide these resources to students in exchange for their dedication to learning
                    relevant life and career skills. <br><br> Consequently, students will display their best
                     works in exhibitions at the school's gallery – The Ghifted Gallery of Fine Art
                      (A world-class African art gallery), which will be built in Aburi, Ghana.
                       This space will allow students to access a wider arts community, showcase their skills,
                        advertise their services, and gain private clients.  . </p>
